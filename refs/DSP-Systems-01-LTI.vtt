00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.000
In general when we talk about signal
processing, we imagine a situation where

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.240
we have an input signal, x of n,
an output signal, y of n, produceD

3
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.350
by some sort of black box here that
manipulates the input into the output.

4
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.000
We can write the relationship
mathematically Like so

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.320
where y then is equal to some operator
H that is applied to the input x of n.

6
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.480
Already when we draw this block diagram

7
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.830
we are making assumptions on
the structure of the process in device

8
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.140
in the sense that we consider a system
with a single input and a single output.

9
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.570
We could imagine system with
multiple inputs or multiple outputs.

10
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.860
But even with these limitations,
the possibilities for

11
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.440
what goes inside this box here
are pretty much limitless.

12
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.500
And unless we impose some structure on the
kind of processing that happens in this

13
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.460
block, we will not be able to say
anything particularly meaningful

14
00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.220
about the filtering operation.

15
00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.910
So the first requirement that we
imposed on a filter is linearity.

16
00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:07.060
Linearity means that if we have two
inputs and we take a linear combination

17
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.990
of said inputs while the output is
a linear combination of outputs.

18
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.410
That could have been obtained by
filtering each sequence independently.

19
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.740
This is actually a very
reasonable requirement, for

20
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.820
instance take a situation where you
processing device is an amplifier and

21
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.200
you connect a guitar to your amplifier.

22
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.160
Now if you play one note and
then you play the same note louder,

23
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.285
you expect the amplifier to
produce just a louder note.

24
00:01:35.285 --> 00:01:39.401
[SOUND] Similarly,
if you play one note and

25
00:01:39.401 --> 00:01:45.162
then another note, and
then you play two notes together,

26
00:01:45.162 --> 00:01:49.985
you expect the amplifier
to amplify the sum of two

27
00:01:49.985 --> 00:01:55.292
notes as the sum of two
independent amplifications.

28
00:01:55.292 --> 00:02:02.156
[MUSIC]

29
00:02:02.156 --> 00:02:05.960
Now note that this is not necessarily
the case in all situations.

30
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.030
For instance, in some kinds of rock music
you want to introduce some distortion and

31
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.910
so you add a fuzz box.

32
00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.398
That will distort the signal non-linearly
to create very interesting effects but

33
00:02:17.398 --> 00:02:20.872
that belong to a completely
different category of processing.

34
00:02:20.872 --> 00:02:30.204
[MUSIC]

35
00:02:30.204 --> 00:02:35.150
The second requirement that we impose on
the processing device is time invariance.

36
00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.370
Time invariance, in layman terms,
simply means that the system will behave

37
00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.690
exactly in the same way independently
of when it's switched on.

38
00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.235
Mathematically, we can say that if y[n] is
the output of the system when the input is

39
00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:54.490
x[n], well if we put a delayed version
of the input inside the system,

40
00:02:54.490 --> 00:03:00.680
x of n minus n-0, what we get is
the same output delayed by n-0.

41
00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.120
And, again, we can use a guitar
amplifier as an example.

42
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.720
If I turn it on today, well I expect it to

43
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.930
amplify the notes exactly in the same
way that it amplified them yesterday.

44
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.550
But again,
some types of guitar effects exploit

45
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.950
time variance to introduce a different
flavor to the music that's being played.

46
00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.394
For instance, the wah pedal
is a time varying effect that

47
00:03:23.394 --> 00:03:27.723
will change the envelope of a sound
In ways that are not time invariant.

48
00:03:27.723 --> 00:03:37.723
[MUSIC]

49
00:03:39.655 --> 00:03:44.190
So what are the ingredients that go
into a linear time-invariant system?

50
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.500
Well, linear ingredients.

51
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.750
Addition, which is a linear operation,
scalar multiplication,

52
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.360
another linear operation, and delays.

53
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.320
Another requirement that is not mandatory,
but makes a lot of sense if you want to

54
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:04.070
use linear time variance system in your
real time, is that the system be cause

55
00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.250
by that we mean that the system
can only have access to input and

56
00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.600
output values from the past.

57
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.930
In that case, you can write the input
output relationship as follows.

58
00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:20.420
The output is a linear functional
of past values of the input and

59
00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:21.680
past values of the output.
