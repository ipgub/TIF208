00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:04.360
In today's Signal of the Day,
we have a look at

2
00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:09.570
an important problem in room acoustics
entitled Can One Hear the Shape of a Room?

3
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:16.280
Let us first investigate how sound
propagates in a room between a sender, or

4
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.220
a loud speaker, s, and
the receiver, or a microphone, r.

5
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.340
Which is illustrated in
the following figure.

6
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.360
The first sound to reach
the microphone corresponds to

7
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.820
the direct transmission
path depicted in orange.

8
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.290
But together with this direct transmission
echos from the walls also arrive at

9
00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.919
the microphone depicted in purple here.

10
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.350
So walls act essentially as mirrors.

11
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.350
Every time a sound hits the wall,
part of the sound is reflected in

12
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.270
such a way that the incident's
angle equals the reflection angle.

13
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.340
These angles are defined with respect
to the normal of the walls ni and

14
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.820
nj, respectively.

15
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.000
Part of the signal is also absorbed by
the wall which depends on the type of

16
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.790
material the wall is made of.

17
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.110
The energy absorbed by the wall
is transformed into heat,

18
00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.730
which increases the wall's
temperature very slightly.

19
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.080
This phenomenon is generally
referred to as diffuse reflection.

20
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.620
These echoes act as virtual
sources of the original source.

21
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.380
For example, here it's a virtual
source which corresponds to

22
00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.990
the reflection with respect to
this wall and here is a second

23
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.890
virtual source corresponding
to the reflection given here.

24
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.680
Echos generate themselves,

25
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.090
new echos from other walls that
we call higher generation echos.

26
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.670
And this goes on and on until the energy
of the signal is fully absorbed.

27
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.530
The line in green represents, for
example, a second generation echo.

28
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.280
First echo here.

29
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.710
This point, second here.

30
00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.999
And this corresponds to
a second order in each source,

31
00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:02.080
until it reaches the microphone.

32
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.630
We can now look at the simulation of how
sound propagates inside a complex room.

33
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.958
This cool video was produced by one of
our lab members, Dick Schroeder, and

34
00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:18.370
illustrates how a pulse emitted
at a loud speaker propagates in

35
00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.548
room until all the pulse
energy is dissipated

36
00:02:31.612 --> 00:02:36.207
From our explanation, it seems that
sounds propagation is a fairly complex

37
00:02:36.207 --> 00:02:41.018
phenomenon involving the super position
of a signal and its different echoes,

38
00:02:41.018 --> 00:02:45.450
such that the derivation of
a model might not be very simple.

39
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.640
Nevertheless, in room acoustics,

40
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.840
sound levels are low such that the Linear
model is a good approximation.

41
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.540
From what we have just learned in class,

42
00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.190
a linear time invarying system is entirely
characterized by its impulse response.

43
00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.230
By definition, the response of
the system to an impulse signal.

44
00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.180
We introduce by analogy the concept
of a room impulse response.

45
00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.860
So describes the audio channel between
the sender S and the receiver R.

46
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.500
So room impulse response simply sums
up the direct path transmission and

47
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.920
the subsequent attenuated echos.

48
00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.200
Let us now look at different
room impulse responses.

49
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.130
For example,
the one of our lab conference room.

50
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.910
Here we plot, on the top, the first
second of the room impulse response.

51
00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.960
And we also zoom in to the first
70 milliseconds at the bottom.

52
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.020
We observe that the early part of the room
impulse response contains more or

53
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:52.110
less isolated well pronounced peaks
that correspond to individual echos.

54
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.590
But non-flat fading,
diffusivity of reflections and

55
00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.760
the diffraction all unite
in the latter part of

56
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.940
the room impulse response to create
noise like exponential decay.

57
00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.840
Of course,
an equally important contribution is from

58
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.640
the fact that echoes get denser and
denser as time passes.

59
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.090
The rate of the decay varies
wildly between different rooms and

60
00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.230
is linked to the so-called
reverberation time or P60.

61
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:29.220
Which is defined as a time for reflections
of a direct signal to decay by 60 DB.

62
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.620
It varies from around a second in
a speech-only lecture hall to about two

63
00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.040
seconds for
a general purpose auditorium, to for

64
00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.350
example, more than eight seconds in
the Notre Dame cathedral in Paris.

65
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.180
It is a very good idea to listen
to room impulse responses.

66
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.010
By doing that,

67
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.332
we can really appreciate the difference
between various acoustic spaces.

68
00:04:51.332 --> 00:04:57.693
[SOUND] Let us

69
00:04:57.693 --> 00:05:02.220
look at another room impulse response,
that of the Lausanne Cathedral.

70
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.310
Again, we plucked the first second of
the room impulse response on the top and

71
00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.340
we also zoom in the first 70
milliseconds at the bottom.

72
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:12.545
Again, let's listen to it.

73
00:05:12.545 --> 00:05:18.894
[SOUND].

74
00:05:20.937 --> 00:05:24.165
Measured or
synthetic room impulse responses can be

75
00:05:24.165 --> 00:05:29.400
used to recreate the acoustic
impression of the corresponding space.

76
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.340
If we convolve a room impulse response of
a cathedral with the sound sample measured

77
00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.060
in a room without echo,

78
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:41.070
the resulting signal will sound as
if it was recorded in the cathedral.

79
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.890
This process is called auralization.

80
00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:44.600
It is used, for

81
00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:50.280
example, in virtual reality to create
realistically sounding virtual spaces.

82
00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.570
Another application example is,
of course, in music production.

83
00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.370
As you will hear,
even this simple convulation can

84
00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:03.510
evoke correct mental imagery about
the space we are auralizing.

85
00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.560
Consider the following sound sample.

86
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.950
>> Can one hear the shape of a room?

87
00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:11.980
>> It does sound dry.

88
00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.550
Now let's oralize it.

89
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.390
First, let's hear what
happens when we convolve this

90
00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:20.210
dry sound with the impulse response
of our lab conference room.

91
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.140
>> Can one hear the shape of a room?

92
00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.810
Now let's do all the auralization with
the cathedral's room impulse response.

93
00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:37.990
>> Can one hear the shape of a room?

94
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:42.019
>> An important practical question is
how to measure room impulse responses.

95
00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:48.020
As they are response to an impulse,
the first idea is to simply use

96
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:52.370
an impulsive source of sound and record
the room response with a microphone.

97
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.870
But, there are numerous
drawbacks to this simple idea.

98
00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:02.370
Room impulse responses is
the response to an idealized post,

99
00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.460
a direct delta function.

100
00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:09.160
Realistic impulsive sources are only
approximations of the direct, and

101
00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.390
usually not very good ones.

102
00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:16.570
Even if we might think that popping
a balloon or firing a starter pistol

103
00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:19.920
generates a very good impulse,
In reality, this is not true.

104
00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.630
Repeatability is also an issue.

105
00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:26.790
Popping different balloons
generates different sounds.

106
00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:31.510
Another way of measuring a room impulse
response consists of playing a known

107
00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:35.810
sound through the loudspeaker and
then deconvolve it in the spectral domain.

108
00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:41.250
In the picture you see how we
measured the room impulse response of

109
00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:43.270
the Lausanne Cathedral.

110
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:48.140
We placed a special loudspeaker,
a so-called omnidirectional loudspeaker in

111
00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:53.498
the center of the picture and we played
actually what is known as a sine sweep,

112
00:07:53.498 --> 00:07:57.690
which is sinusoid of increasing frequency.

113
00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:01.970
It resembles a little bit of sounds
that backs in it when they actually do

114
00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:03.960
the process of echo location.

115
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:08.060
But, let's not get too much
into the details here and

116
00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.680
come back into our main
question of interest.

117
00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:13.340
Can one hear the shape of the room?

118
00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:18.620
The question is whether we can reconstruct
the shape of the room using only echos.

119
00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:21.930
Consider the following
experimental set up.

120
00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:24.230
We put some microphones into a room.

121
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:28.240
We would like to reconstruct the room's
shape from what the microphones record

122
00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:32.810
when we clap our hands, that is from
the recorded impulse responses.

123
00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:38.050
Room impulse responses contain
peaks that correspond to echoes and

124
00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:39.919
echoes are muddled by image sources.

125
00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:43.240
But if the room is not too complicated,

126
00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:47.280
locations of image sources tell
us how the room looks like.

127
00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:51.430
So we can rephrase the room
reconstruction problem into a problem of

128
00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:54.350
localizing a certain
number of image sources.

129
00:08:55.580 --> 00:09:00.140
At the next level of abstraction we
forget that they are image sources.

130
00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:05.730
And we just attack a problem of localizing
multiple sources and meeting impulses.

131
00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:09.620
In our lab we developed a theory for
reconstructing the shape of

132
00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:14.620
a room from impulse responses and
we ran some experiments to test it.

133
00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:18.470
The first round of experiments
was run in our conference room,

134
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:20.219
mentioned already multiple times.

135
00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:25.630
So you see Schon in the left
part of the image and

136
00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:28.530
you see the model of
the room at the bottom.

137
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:30.250
We built the wall out of tables so

138
00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:34.090
we could move around the room and
change its geometry.

139
00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:38.210
We then added some microphones and
loud speakers and we're ready to go.

140
00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:43.920
Here are the results for
two different room configurations.

141
00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.240
In both experiments,

142
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:51.420
all dimensions of the room were estimated
to high accuracy using five microphones.

143
00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:56.770
For example, the height of the ceiling is
estimated within an error of only one or

144
00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:58.370
two centimeters.

145
00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:02.250
Encouraged by the success of this
experiment, we went straight for

146
00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:03.360
the Major League.

147
00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:06.450
We did experiments in
the Lausanne Cathedral.

148
00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:10.580
Of course, we didn't really hope to
reconstruct the detailed geometry of

149
00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:11.720
the cathedral.

150
00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:16.090
That's because cathedrals with their
curved surfaces, domes, decorations and

151
00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:20.520
columns are much more complicated than
the rooms we developed our algorithm for.

152
00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:26.630
Nevertheless, we were able to reconstruct
the main dimensions of an alcove at

153
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:29.680
the side of the cathedral
with quite good accuracy.
